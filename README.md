# Campus-Connect
An android application for campus notifications

During the monitoring of Information systems, Management systems, etc. it is often required that people are alerted about some events and information in real time, generally through circulars, notices or spreading information through various possible ways physically. But in this project ,a smarter way of alerting the people by an advanced means of notification through a mobile application is proposed. Here a unified platform is designed for the delivery of notifications to android smartphones/tablets regarding any relevant or required information. So for implementation purpose “CAMPUS CONNECT: An Android Application for Campus Notifications” involves building the proposed mobile application for a college which involves updating notifications to students at different levels.
